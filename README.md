💡 Design Decisions
Tree-sitter Version

The project intentionally uses

tree-sitter==0.21.3

to maintain compatibility with

tree-sitter-languages==1.10.2
No Vector Database

Instead of using embeddings or FAISS, the chatbot directly sends the uploaded source code to the LLM.

Benefits

Faster
Lightweight
No Torch dependency
Better live demo experience
Graceful AI Fallback

If no GROQ_API_KEY is configured,

the application still supports

Static Analysis
Complexity Analysis
Security Scan
Bug Detection
Similarity Checker
PDF Report

Only AI Review, AI Refactoring, and Chatbot require the API key.
