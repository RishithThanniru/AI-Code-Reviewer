# 🤖 AI Code Reviewer

**A multi-language, AI-powered code review assistant** — built with Streamlit, Tree-sitter, and the Groq API (Llama 3.3). Upload a source file and get structural analysis, static warnings, AI-detected bugs, a security scan, a deep AI code review, refactoring suggestions, a code Q&A chatbot, a duplicate-code checker, and a downloadable PDF report — all in one app.

## 🔎 Overview

AI Code Reviewer analyzes source code across **9 languages** (Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Kotlin) and combines classic static analysis with LLM-powered review. It was built incrementally over 18 days, starting from Python-only AST parsing and growing into a full multi-language review suite with AI bug detection, security scanning, refactoring, and a code-aware chatbot — all wrapped in an interactive Streamlit dashboard with persistent history and PDF export.

## ✨ Features

### Core Analysis
- 📋 **AST-based parsing** for Python; **Tree-sitter parsing** for Java, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust and Kotlin
- 📊 Function / class / import / loop / conditional extraction
- 📈 Interactive dashboards & charts (Plotly)
- ⏱ Time-complexity estimation
- 🗄 SQLite analysis history with search, trend graph, and clear-history
- 📄 One-click downloadable PDF report

### AI-Powered Review
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Multi-Language Support | Automatic language detection + Tree-sitter parsing, highlighting, and syntax tree for 9 languages |
| Multi-Language Code Analysis | Function/class/import/loop/conditional extraction, dashboards & charts for every supported language |
| AI Code Review | Groq-powered bug detection, code smells, security analysis, performance & improvement suggestions |
| AI Bug Detection | Infinite loops, division by zero, dead code, duplicate code, unused variables |
| Security Scanner | SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe `eval()`/`exec()`, weak hashing, command injection |
| AI Refactoring | AI-generated refactored code + explanation, without changing behavior |
| Code Similarity Checker | Compare two files: similarity %, matching blocks, shared functions/classes |
| Code Q&A Chatbot | Ask questions about the uploaded file, answered with the file as live context |

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd AI-Code-Reviewer

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. (Optional but recommended) enable AI features
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and add a free key from https://console.groq.com/keys

# 5. Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

The app works fully for static analysis, bug detection, and the security scanner **without** a Groq key. Only the AI Review, AI Refactoring, and Chatbot tabs require `GROQ_API_KEY` to be set.

## 🧪 Try It Out

Sample files are included under `samples/` — several languages, intentionally seeded with bugs and security issues so you can demo every tab:

- `samples/buggy.py` — unused variables, infinite loop, division by zero
- `samples/insecure.py` — SQL injection, hardcoded password, weak hashing
- `samples/Sample.java`, `samples/sample.js`, `samples/sample.go` — multi-language parsing demo
- `samples/complexity.py` — time-complexity estimation demo

## 📌 Notes on Design Decisions

- **`tree-sitter==0.21.3` is pinned intentionally.** Newer `tree-sitter` releases changed the `Language()` constructor signature and are incompatible with `tree-sitter-languages==1.10.2`'s prebuilt grammars — installing the latest `tree-sitter` will break multi-language parsing.
- **The chatbot sends the file directly as context** instead of using a FAISS + embeddings pipeline. A single source file comfortably fits an LLM's context window, so this avoids a heavy `torch`/`transformers` dependency and a first-run model download — much more reliable for a live demo.
- **Every AI-powered feature degrades gracefully** when `GROQ_API_KEY` isn't set: the UI shows a clear message instead of crashing, so the rest of the app (static analysis, bug detection, security scan, similarity checker, PDF report) still works out of the box.

## 🗺 Roadmap Recap (Days 1–18)

Days 1–11 established the core: AST parsing, static analysis, complexity estimation, PDF reporting, and SQLite history. Days 12–18 added multi-language support via Tree-sitter, AI-powered bug/security/refactoring analysis via Groq, and a code similarity checker.
