# 🤖 AI Code Reviewer

An advanced **AI-powered, multi-language code review platform** built using **Python, Streamlit, Tree-sitter, and Groq Llama 3.3**. The application combines traditional static code analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate code reviews, detect bugs, identify security vulnerabilities, suggest refactoring improvements, answer code-related questions, and generate professional PDF reports.
